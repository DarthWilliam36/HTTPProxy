# HTTPProxy
HTTP Server Proxy made in Python 

This is a simple HTTP Serber proxy made in Python that works by responding to the HTTP CONNECT method and establishing a connection between the target server and the client machine.

<h1>TO SET UP:</h1>
<p>Scroll to the bottom of the python file and change "server_address" to your local IP address and the port you want to host on.</p>

<p>If you are using proxy on your local network, make sure to set up port forwarding to the server port you set. This will make sure the router will forward any incoming packets to your device. </p>
